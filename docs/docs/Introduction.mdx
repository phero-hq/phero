  <h3>Full-stack type-safety with pure TypeScript</h3>

Phero is the no-hassle and type-safe glue between your backend and frontend. TypeScript is at the core of it all. Development with Phero goes in these steps:

1. **Build your backend.** Define your domain models and functions in regular, plain TypeScript.
2. **Run the CLI.** This runs the server and generates an SDK for your frontend, or multiple frontends at the same time.
3. **Call your backend-functions from the frontend, as if they were local.** This includes type-safety and error-handling.

This boosts your frontend development:

💪 Use functions and domain models on the frontend, defined on the backend.  
🧨 Handle errors on the frontend, thrown by the backend.  
🤝 Stop assuming data is of the type you’re expecting. You know it is, period.  
✅ No more mistakes with the specs of the API, like path, arguments or headers.

Backend development becomes a breeze as well:

🫶 Use TypeScript to define your domain models. No need for an extra language or DSL to learn and maintain, like with GraphQL or tRPC.  
📋 Know when you break compatability with the frontend, before even running it: TypeScript has your back.  
😶‍🌫️ No more outdated specs or documentation about endpoints (and what method, headers or arguments they expect).  
🚀 The server can be deployed anywhere, either on one of the cloud platforms or a regular Node server.

## Quick Example

```ts
// api/src/phero.ts

import { createService } from "@phero/server"

async function helloWorld(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `Hi there, ${name}!`
}

export const helloWorldService = createService({ helloWorld })
```

That's enough to create your first service and let Phero generate the client:

```ts
// app/src/phero.ts

import { PheroClient } from "./phero.generated"

const fetch = window.fetch.bind(this)
const client = new PheroClient(fetch)

async function main() {
  const message = await client.helloWorldService.helloWorld("Jim")
  console.log(message) // `Hi there, Jim!`
}

main()
```

From the perspective of the backend-code, `helloWorld` is a regular asynchronous function like any other. It could fetch records from your database, validate the permissions of a user, or do anything that you'd expect from server-code, it's up to you.

On the frontend-side, `helloWorld` is a function that requires the same arguments and return type as the function on the server. It acts like a local function, because it is! Phero handles the request and validation, so you won't have to.
